<h1>Future Game and Media Projects</h1>
<h2>We're Dedicated to Quality. Please, Check Out Our Future Projects!</h2>

<h3>Many projects of ours are coming to see the light of day in the coming years, some sooner than others. But why wait? 
<br>Here, we have detailed pages to review and read up on some of our coming indie game projects.</h3>

<h4>Project ISO</h4>
<h3>Project ISO is an upcoming 3D Platformer game starring an unlikely hero in space.
<br>Explore a desolate solar system, where you are the only inhabitant. You must search not only for your people,
<br>but a way to reach them too. Stay tuned for more information regarding this title (and its release), in the future.</h3>

<h4>Ataraxia</h4>
<h3>Ataraxia is a first-person survival horror game set in a city at the bottom of the ocean, surrounded by a giant glass dome.
<br>You are surrounded by your fellow cityfolk; however, there's also a body-snatching cryptid on the loose.
<br>YOU CANT TRUST ANYONE.
<br>You must make your way through the city as an electrical engineer, solving the city's power problem (and supernatural infestation).
<br>Stay tuned for more information regarding this title (and its release), in the future.</h3>
